    "# Description: \n",
    "Suppose you are a secret agent in UCSD. After completion of finals and papers, you are going back to a journey of a secret mission during winter break. Surprisingly, a young man/woman like you, is actually a senior officer! Therefore you have the authority to choose the location where you are going to pursue the task. The weather condition of the target city and its distance from UCSD are very crucial and you must also keep the location classified. This project of chatbot will help you decide which city you want to go and will also provide you with an encoded name of the city. So please take the advantage and make the choice, agent! (The amount of cities available at this moment is limited and I hope this project will be strengthened when I acquire more knowledge about programming and data science.)"
